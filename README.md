# Static-Code-Analysis
Readability counts. This is an important point in the zen of Python.
​​Code is read much more often than it is written. PEP8, is a document that provides guidelines to improve the readability of code and make it consistent across the wide spectrum of Python code.​Here are the most important points extracted for you:​​

Prefer Spaces no tabs for indentation.
​

Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
​

Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters.
​

Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.
​

Put comments on a line of their own.
​

Use docstrings.
​

Use spaces around operators and after commas.
​

Name your functions and methods using lower_case_with_underscores.
​

Name your classes using CamelCase.
​

Name your constants in all capital letters with underscores separating words, like MAX_FILE_UPLOAD_SIZE, YEAR.
